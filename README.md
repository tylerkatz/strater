# Strater

Strater is a command-line tool that helps traders plan their account progression and capital growth through multiple stages. It allows you to model different risk management and capital allocation strategies across accounts, helping you chart a clear path from your starting capital to your desired portfolio.

Whether you're planning to scale from a small account to larger ones, managing multiple trading accounts with different risk parameters, or developing a progression strategy for fund management, Strater helps you:

- Model different account growth scenarios
- Plan risk-appropriate position sizing at each stage
- Track progress against your scaling targets
- Analyze potential outcomes across multiple accounts
- Export detailed progression plans and analysis
